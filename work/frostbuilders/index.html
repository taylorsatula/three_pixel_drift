			<p id="projectdescription">
			
			Frost Builders is a remodeling and construction company based out of Harbor Springs, MI. They have been serving the greater Emmet county area for twenty years. I was commissioned in early 2013 to create a brand-new online presence for Frost Builders. Since they had no previous website, it was my job to put them on the digital map.
			
			<br><br>
			
			We sat down and laid out a concrete plan for how we were going to build a web presence as strong as their homes. The first step was creating a solid website to showcase their past work and deliver contact information to suppliers and customers quickly and efficiently. This was a key concern for Frost Builders as their clients and suppliers would regularly search Google for contact information and turn up empty-handed. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			After the site was established, we moved on to setting up professional email addresses rather than their previous Gmail addresses. They then had the ability to keep using their mail client as they did before, but it would show their new, professional email address in correspondence. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			The final step of the project was local outreach online. This was accomplished with targeted Google Adwords campaigns and curating local business search listings. Now when someone looks for construction companies in Northern Michigan, Frost Builders is always visible along with accurate contact information.
			
			<br><br>
			
			After launching their website, they have seen an uptake in business and have better relationships with their vendors. Ongoing support with web analytics has helped hone their website to give visitors exactly what they need and when they need it.
