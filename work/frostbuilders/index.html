			<p id="projectdescription">
			
			
			Frost Builders is a remodeling and construction company based out of Harbor Springs, MI. They have been serving the greater Emmet county area for twenty years.
			<br><br>
			
			I was commissioned in early 2013 to create a brand-new online presence for Frost Builders. Up till this point they not have any presence online. It was my job to put them on the digital map. To begin the project we sat down and laid out a concrete strategy plan for how we were going to create a core website and branch out from there. The first step was creating a solid website where potential clients could browse through their past work but also a website that would deliver contact information to suppliers or current customers quickly and efficiently. This was a main concern for Frost Builders as they told me they would regularly have clients and suppliers Google them for information only to turn up a blank page. 
			 
			 <br><br>
			 
			 After the base site was established we moved on to setting up email addresses with the website as the extension as opposed to their current Gmail email. I set this up soon there after. They then had the ability to use their normal email clients as they would with their old address but it would show their new and much more official email at their domain.
			 
			 <br><br>
			 
			 The final step of their project was local outreach online. This was accomplished through targeted Google Adwords campaigns and submission and curation of local business search directory listings. Now when someone looks for construction companies in Northern Michigan they pop right up and potential customers can get in contact with them.
			 
			 After having their website set up they have seen a uptake in business and a lot less frustrated contacts. Ongoing support through analytical software has helped hone their website to give visitors exactly what they need and when they need it.
