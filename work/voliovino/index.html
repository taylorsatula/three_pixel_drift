			Turnaround time was extremely important to the folks at Volio Vino.
			</span>
			Volio Vino is a international wine distributor based out of Denver, Colorado. They work with hundreds of businesses across the country to bring them wine from fifty-three regions and five countries. They started in 2003 when their founder, Charles Lazzara, was living in Italy, studying cuisine and the Italian language. It was during this six-month stay that he realized his passion for wine, the history inside each bottle, and the people that make it. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			I embarked on this project in the Summer of 2011 as an intern with the awesome team at Pine Lake Design. I primarily took mockups done in programs like Photoshop or Fireworks and created functional websites out of those images.
			
			<br><br>
			
			During a tight deadline, an employee asked to see my work, which I happily showed them. When they began yell at me for not starting yet, I gleefully responded that they weren't looking at an image. It is a challenging process to make pixel-perfect renditions of a mockup, but this was already a final product that was absolutely identical to the original image. Everyone went home happy after that. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			I also worked on some web animations while I was there. I created a slider from scratch that would let you pick your wine in a drill-down style and finally present your chosen wine with all of its detailed information. It was used on this project and when I completed my internship it was kept by Pine Lake for future projects since they liked it so much.
