			Turnaround time was extremely important to the folks at Volio Vino.
			</span>
			Volio Vino is a international wine distributor based out of Denver, Colorado. They work with hundreds of businesses across the country to bring them wine from fifty-three regions and five countries. They started in 2003 when their founder Charles Lazzara, was living in Italy; studying wine and the Italian language. It was during this six month stay that he realized his passion for wine; the history in each bottle and the people that make it. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			I embarked on this project in summer of 2011 with the awesome team at <a href="http://www.pinelakedesign.com">Pine Lake Design</a> as an intern. I primarily worked as someone who would take mockups done in programs like Photoshop or Fireworks and create a functional website out of it. It is a challenging process to make pixel-perfect renditions of the mockup. I remember vividly when I was interning at Pine Lake there was a deadline coming up and someone asked to see my work. I happily showed them and to my surprise they called me up angrily as to "WHY HAVEN'T YOU STARTED YET??" to which I gleefully responded that they weren't looking at just an image but they were actually looking at a final product that was absolutely identical to the original mockup. Safe to say they were satisfied after that.

			I also worked on animation of content while I was there. I created a slider from scratch that would let you pick your wine in a drill-down style and finally present your chosen wine with all of its detailed information. It was used on this project and when I completed my internship it was kept my Pine Lake for future projects as they liked it so much.
