			Naked CSS Day is one day per year (April 9th) that web designers &amp; developers come together to remove the styling of their website in the name of standards based design and good practices. Accessibility and accountability are growing more and more important as people have begun to have access to the web everywhere they go. Users deserve to get a functional experience no matter how they get there or if they're using assistive devices. Removing the styling of your website exposes it for what it is. No shady tactics or poorly formed design ideas will function correctly. The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of html, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good 'ol play on words. <br><br>
			
			I have been in charge of it for four years now and is growing exponentially. It's sort of my baby. <br><br>
			
			The project was abandoned in 2009 by <a href="http://www.dustindiaz.com">a fellow developer</a> and I picked it up as I was (and continue to be) a big proponent of web standards and accessible content. I've lived in close proximity with people with disabilities and I've seen how much sloppy development actually effects people who cannot browser the internet the same way as you or I.
