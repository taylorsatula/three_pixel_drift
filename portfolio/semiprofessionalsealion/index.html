			Taylor is a great addition to the team. We couldn't do what we do without his knowledge.

			FoodCircles curates great, local restaurants and lets you buy a dish for $1 or more. 100% of your purchase gives 1 (or more) children the food they need to survive.
			
			<br><br>
			
			 I started working at Food Circles a little while after their Managing Director contacted me to see if I would be interested in becoming part of the team. He was looking for someone to work on the website and do analytical tests to better understand the people that we are helping. I seem to fit the bill for that. I'm really excited to become part of the team at Food Circles.  Most of the work I've done so far at food circles are tweaks to improve the website and make it run more efficiently.
			 
			 <br><br>
			 
			 While I'm devoting my time towards Food Circles I mainly focus on collecting and analyzing large sets of analytical data to optimize the experience of the end-user which pretty much means I  figure out where people are going and where they are leaving and try to improve their experience so that they continue through to completion of whatever their intended task was. Also, my other main tasks are in customer retention after a sale through outreach programs and email campaigns.
